The **GEOMETOR** project is on a mission to explore the architecture of all that is.

The primary activities have been focused on exploring geometrical structures - in both mathematics and nature. 

At the heart is the `GEOMETOR explorer`_ - a Python library for building and
analyzing geometric constructions with sympbolic algebra.
