The **GEOMETOR** project is on a mission to explore the architecture of all
that is.

The primary activities have been focused on exploring geometrical structures -
in both mathematics and nature. 

At the heart is the `GEOMETOR explorer`_ - a Python library for building and
analyzing geometric constructions with sympbolic algebra.

GEOMETOR
========

Overview
--------
**GEOMETOR** is an open-source initiative that aims to dive deep into the
fundamental aspects of geometry, nature, and logic. Through a series of
repositories, our mission is to study, model, and decode geometric
constructions and their relationship to the natural and mathematical world.

Repositories
------------
Our work spans a wide range of subjects, each with a dedicated repository. Here
is a quick overview:

- ``elements``: Establish the building blocks of geometry and their logical interconnections.
- ``divine``: Investigate and replicate the divine proportion through modeling.
- ``explorer``: Develop and explore geometrical models interactively.
- ``euclid``: Extract and encode the geometric wisdom of Euclid's classic work.
- ``phyllotaxis``: Explore and model the geometric underpinnings of plant structures.
- ``pappus``: Examine and interpret the geometric intricacies of Pappus' Theorem.

Contributing
------------
We welcome contributions from anyone interested in geometry, mathematics,
nature, or programming. Feel free to contribute to our repositories, raise
issues, or propose enhancements.

License
-------
Each repository within the GEOMETOR organization holds its specific licensing
information. We generally use open-source licenses to facilitate the widespread
use and adaptation of our tools.
