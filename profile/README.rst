exploring the architecture of all that is
-----------------------------------------

**GEOMETOR** is an open-source initiative that aims to dive deep into the
fundamental aspects of geometry, nature, and logic. Through a series of
repositories, our mission is to study, model, and decode geometric
constructions and their relationship to the natural and mathematical world.

**GEOMETOR** is an organization led by `phi ARCHITECT`_ 


Repositories
------------
Our work spans a wide range of subjects, each with a dedicated repository. Here
is a quick overview:

- `elements`_: codify the fundamentals of geometry and logical relationships
- `divine`_: model and analyze the golden ratio
- `euclid`_: extract knowledge from the classic work
- `explorer`_: build and interact with geometric models

.. - `phyllotaxis`_: Explore and model the geometric underpinnings of plant structures.
.. - `pappus`_: Examine and interpret the geometric intricacies of Pappus' Theorem.

At the heart is the `GEOMETOR explorer`_ - a Python library for building and
analyzing geometric constructions with sympbolic algebra.
