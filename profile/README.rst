exploring the architecture of all that is
-----------------------------------------

**GEOMETOR** is an open-source initiative that aims to dive deep into the
fundamental aspects of geometry, nature, and logic.

All of the research and development for **GEOMETOR** is located here in a collection of repositories.
There are many, but these three establish the foundation for the work:

- elements_: codify the fundamentals of geometry and logical relationships
- divine_: model and analyze the golden ratio
- euclid_: extract knowledge from the classic work

.. - explorer_: build and interact with geometric models
.. At the heart is the `GEOMETOR explorer`_ - a Python library for building and
.. analyzing geometric constructions with sympbolic algebra.

.. - `phyllotaxis`_: Explore and model the geometric underpinnings of plant structures.
  .. model and investigate geometry of plants
.. - `pappus`_: Examine and interpret the geometric intricacies of Pappus' Theorem.
  .. model and investigate pappus theorem

Each repository has:

- MIT license
- Python source code
- source for documentation website
- discussion group

The website for each project is statically-generated and hosted through GitHub.
