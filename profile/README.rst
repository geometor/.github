   the machine dreams

All of the research and development for **GEOMETOR** is located here in a
collection of repositories. There are many, but these establish the foundation for the work:

- model_: tools for modeling geometric constructions
- render_: tools for rendering geometric constructions
- divine_: model and analyze the golden ratio
- elements_: extract and codify knowledge from the classic work
- explorer_: explore and interact with geometric models

Each repository has:

- Python source code
- demo code
- source for project website
- discussion group
- log
- todo list
- MIT license

The website for each project is statically-generated and hosted through GitHub.

.. At the heart is the `GEOMETOR explorer`_ - a Python library for building and
.. analyzing geometric constructions with sympbolic algebra.

.. - phyllotaxis
  .. model and investigate geometry of plants

.. - pappus
  .. model and investigate pappus theorem
