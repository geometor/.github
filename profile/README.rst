exploring the architecture of all that is
-----------------------------------------

**GEOMETOR** is an open-source initiative dedicated to the
fundamental aspects of geometry, nature, and logic.

All of the research and development for **GEOMETOR** is located here in a collection of repositories.
There are many, but these three establish the foundation for the work:

- elements_: tools for modeling and rendering geometric constructions
- divine_: model and analyze the golden ratio
- euclid_: extract knowledge from the classic work

Each repository has:

- Python source code
- demo code
- source for project website
- discussion group
- log
- todo list
- MIT license

The website for each project is statically-generated and hosted through GitHub.

.. At the heart is the `GEOMETOR explorer`_ - a Python library for building and
.. analyzing geometric constructions with sympbolic algebra.

.. - phyllotaxis
  .. model and investigate geometry of plants

.. - pappus
  .. model and investigate pappus theorem
